# AI Trading OS Plans

## Completed Foundation Scope

- Project metadata and uv-compatible dependency management.
- FastAPI health, readiness, system status, and scanning-state endpoints.
- Async PostgreSQL models, Alembic migration, repositories, and unit of work.
- Worker process with heartbeat and health-check jobs.
- Telegram disabled mode, authorization, Russian text validation, and one-emoji formatting.
- Future provider and agent contracts without live calls or analysis.
- Safety scan for forbidden real-order execution concepts.
- Documentation and tests for foundation behavior.
- Phase 2 foundation hardening: Docker runtime defaults, internal API key security, redaction,
  UTC normalization, UoW lifecycle hardening, architecture boundary tests, typed provider
  contracts, disabled adapters, production Twelve Data/FMP adapters, and MockTransport-backed
  provider contract tests.
- Phase 3A data-quality foundation: duplicate-safe candle/event storage repositories,
  deterministic data-quality snapshots, and historical replay utilities for tests.
- Phase 3B feature engine foundation: deterministic closed-candle feature models, feature
  calculation engine, feature service over repository protocols, and safety tests confirming no
  strategy/signals/trading activation.

## Current Implementation Status

The repository has completed the foundation phase, Phase 2 hardening/data adapters, Phase 3A
data-quality foundation, and Phase 3B deterministic feature-engine foundation. Production Twelve
Data and FMP adapters exist, but live integrations remain disabled by default. Scanning state can be
enabled or disabled, but no strategy, signal generation, AI agent, paper-trading, or execution flow
is connected.

## Future Phases

- Phase 2: market-data and calendar adapters — completed as disabled-by-default factories plus
  production adapters covered by MockTransport-backed contract tests
- Phase 3A: data-quality foundation — completed without trading analysis or decisions
- Phase 3B: deterministic feature engine foundation — completed without trading decisions
- Phase 3C: next phase if applicable; not started
- Phase 4: analytical agents and Decision Engine
- Phase 5: Russian Chief AI explanations
- Phase 6: Telegram signal delivery
- Phase 7: backtesting and paper trading

## Explicit Non-Goals

- No broker execution.
- No real trading.
- No strategy logic.
- No indicators or signal generation.
- No OpenAI calls.
- No fabricated market data or scan results.

## Known Risks

- Local Docker or PostgreSQL availability can affect verification.
- Future provider adapters must preserve disabled-by-default behavior.
- Telegram message validation is intentionally simple and should be tightened as message complexity grows.

## Next Planned Task

Phase 3C is the next phase if applicable. It has not started, and no Phase 3C behavior is active.
