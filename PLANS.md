# AI Trading OS Plans

## Completed Foundation Scope

- Project metadata and uv-compatible dependency management.
- FastAPI health, readiness, system status, and scanning-state endpoints.
- Async PostgreSQL models, Alembic migration, repositories, and unit of work.
- Worker process with heartbeat and health-check jobs.
- Telegram disabled mode, authorization, Russian text validation, and one-emoji formatting.
- Future provider and agent contracts without live calls or analysis.
- Safety scan for forbidden real-order execution concepts.
- Documentation and tests for foundation behavior.
- Phase 2 foundation hardening: Docker runtime defaults, internal API key security, redaction,
  UTC normalization, UoW lifecycle hardening, architecture boundary tests, typed provider
  contracts, disabled adapters, production Twelve Data/FMP adapters, and MockTransport-backed
  provider contract tests.
- Phase 3A data-quality foundation: duplicate-safe candle/event storage repositories,
  deterministic data-quality snapshots, and historical replay utilities for tests.

## Current Implementation Status

The repository has completed the foundation phase, Phase 2 hardening/data adapters, and Phase 3A
data-quality foundation. Production Twelve Data and FMP adapters exist, but live integrations remain
disabled by default. Scanning state can be enabled or disabled, but no analytical engine is
connected.

## Future Phases

- Phase 2: market-data and calendar adapters — completed as disabled-by-default factories plus
  production adapters covered by MockTransport-backed contract tests
- Phase 3A: data-quality foundation — completed without trading analysis or decisions
- Phase 3B: feature engine and deterministic analysis
- Phase 4: analytical agents and Decision Engine
- Phase 5: Russian Chief AI explanations
- Phase 6: Telegram signal delivery
- Phase 7: backtesting and paper trading

## Explicit Non-Goals

- No broker execution.
- No real trading.
- No strategy logic.
- No indicators or signal generation.
- No OpenAI calls.
- No fabricated market data or scan results.

## Known Risks

- Local Docker or PostgreSQL availability can affect verification.
- Future provider adapters must preserve disabled-by-default behavior.
- Telegram message validation is intentionally simple and should be tightened as message complexity grows.

## Next Planned Task

Phase 3B should add a feature-engine foundation for deterministic closed-candle feature extraction
without signal generation, scoring, or trading recommendations.
