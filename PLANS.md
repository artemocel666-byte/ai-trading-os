# AI Trading OS Plans

## Completed Foundation Scope

- Project metadata and uv-compatible dependency management.
- FastAPI health, readiness, system status, and scanning-state endpoints.
- Async PostgreSQL models, Alembic migration, repositories, and unit of work.
- Worker process with heartbeat and health-check jobs.
- Telegram disabled mode, authorization, Russian text validation, and one-emoji formatting.
- Future provider and agent contracts without live calls or analysis.
- Safety scan for forbidden real-order execution concepts.
- Documentation and tests for foundation behavior.
- Phase 2 foundation hardening: Docker runtime defaults, internal API key security, redaction,
  UTC normalization, UoW lifecycle hardening, architecture boundary tests, typed provider
  contracts, disabled adapters, production Twelve Data/FMP adapters, and MockTransport-backed
  provider contract tests.
- Phase 3A data-quality foundation: duplicate-safe candle/event storage repositories,
  deterministic data-quality snapshots, and historical replay utilities for tests.
- Phase 3B feature engine foundation: deterministic closed-candle feature models, feature
  calculation engine, feature service over repository protocols, and safety tests confirming no
  strategy/signals/trading activation.
- Phase 3C indicator/context foundation: deterministic closed-candle context models, context
  calculation engine over Phase 3B features, context service over repository protocols, and safety
  tests confirming no strategy/signals/trading activation.
- Phase 3D analysis snapshot foundation: deterministic readiness report models, analysis snapshot
  engine over Phase 3A/3B/3C outputs, analysis service over repository protocols, and safety tests
  confirming no strategy/signals/trading activation.
- Phase 3E Telegram readiness foundation: local `/snapshot` readiness reports in Telegram,
  UnitOfWork-backed analysis service wiring, local seed data utility, and safety tests confirming no
  strategy/signals/trading activation.
- Phase 3F readiness scheduler foundation: deterministic pair/timeframe readiness plans, latest
  closed-window resolution, snapshot digest payloads, deduplication keys, and safety tests
  confirming no strategy/signals/trading activation.

## Current Implementation Status

The repository has completed the foundation phase, Phase 2 hardening/data adapters, Phase 3A
data-quality foundation, Phase 3B deterministic feature-engine foundation, Phase 3C deterministic
indicator/context foundation, Phase 3D deterministic analysis snapshot/readiness report foundation,
Phase 3E local Telegram readiness-report foundation, and Phase 3F deterministic readiness
scheduler/snapshot digest foundation. Production Twelve Data and FMP adapters exist, but live
integrations remain disabled by default. Scanning state can be enabled or disabled, and Telegram can
request readiness reports, but no strategy, signal generation, AI agent, paper-trading, or execution
flow is connected.

## Future Phases

- Phase 2: market-data and calendar adapters — completed as disabled-by-default factories plus
  production adapters covered by MockTransport-backed contract tests
- Phase 3A: data-quality foundation — completed without trading analysis or decisions
- Phase 3B: deterministic feature engine foundation — completed without trading decisions
- Phase 3C: deterministic indicator/context foundation — completed without trading decisions
- Phase 3D: deterministic analysis snapshot/readiness report foundation — completed without trading decisions
- Phase 3E: local Telegram readiness reports — completed without trading decisions
- Phase 3F: neutral readiness scheduler/snapshot digest foundation — completed without trading decisions
- Phase 4: analytical agents and Decision Engine
- Phase 5: Russian Chief AI explanations
- Phase 6: Telegram signal delivery
- Phase 7: backtesting and paper trading

## Explicit Non-Goals

- No broker execution.
- No real trading.
- No strategy logic.
- No indicators or signal generation.
- No OpenAI calls.
- No fabricated market data or scan results.

## Known Risks

- Local Docker or PostgreSQL availability can affect verification.
- Future provider adapters must preserve disabled-by-default behavior.
- Telegram message validation is intentionally simple and should be tightened as message complexity grows.

## Next Planned Task

Phase 4 is the next phase if applicable. It has not started, and no Phase 4 behavior is active.
